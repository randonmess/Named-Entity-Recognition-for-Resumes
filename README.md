# Named-Entity-Recognition-for-Resumes
Exploring pre-trained transformer model for named entity recognition on resumes

**Note: `model/pytorch/pytorch_model.bin` and `model/tensorflow/tf_model.h5` were too large to be uploaded**

## Objectives
* Use tokenizers and pre-trained models from the HuggingFace Library.
* Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model for Named-Entity Recognition
